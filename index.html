           My name is Daniel Jardine. I am happily married to a beautiful Brazilian princess. My wife and I really enjoy going on long walks and hikes. We have a dog that loves me a lot and a cat that doesn't like me too much, but loves my wife. I also really like playing videogames. Zelda and Final Fantasy are some of my favorite franchises, but I also enjoy competitve games as well like Rocket League and OverWatch. My favorite music is calm video game music that you could sleep to. My outdoor activities include hiking, swimming, running (when I feel like it), and biking (if I had a bike). I like meeting new people, and I also like to stream on Twitch. I am a Hardworker and always try to better myself in everything I do. Someday I think it would be really cool to learn how to play the guitar, as well as learn how to do pixel art. Ever since I was a kid I thought it would be cool to make a video game, now that I am older I am very interested in coding. My favorite thing about coding is when everything comes together and a program works the way you want it to. I find it very fulfilling.
